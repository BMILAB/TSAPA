# TSAPA
README for TSAPA
====================
TSAPA is an R package for identification of tissue-specific alternative polyadenylation sites in plants. This package can identify tissue-specific and constitutive poly(A) sites (tsPAs and csPAs) using the information entropy method. A generic model for rice japonica has been trained and integrated in TSAPA, which can be directly applied to predict tsPAs from any new data of rice japonica without additional inputs. TSAPA also allows users to customize the classification model by selecting desirable features or classifiers for model training on their own data. Given a list of poly(A) sites and the corresponding reference genome sequence, TSAPA is capable of predicting tsPAs for species other than rice japonica. TSAPA can also be used to identify and predict tsPAs in intergenic regions.
